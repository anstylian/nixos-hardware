== Firmware Configuration ==

Not much tweaking of NixOS itself was needed. But we currently cannot automate
the firmware setup, so this must be done by hand.

=== Before installation ===

These settings are needed both for booting the final install, and installer
itself. Therefore, they must be done first.

* ''Disable Secure Boot (but keep UEFI Boot).'' Thankfully doing so is as easy as
  changing any other simple setting.

* ''Disable Intel hardware RAID and use AHCI instead.'' Intel doesn't seem to
  provide a working linux drivr for this. (If you just have SSD it's pointless
  and just slows things down needlessly anyways.)
